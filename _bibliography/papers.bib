	abstract = {Purpose:
              Children with neurodevelopmental disorders historically exhibit lower and more variable nonverbal intelligence (NVIQ) scores compared to their typically developing peers. We hypothesize that the intrinsic characteristics of the tests themselves, particularly the cognitive constructs they assess, may account for both the lower scores and variability across tests and over time. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, we examined the extent to which key cognitive constructs are engaged in NVIQ tests and how these constructs compare across different tests.
            
            
              Method:
              Current editions of seven NVIQ tests were selected based on their relevance in clinical and research settings. Qualitative coding of constructs was developed iteratively by speech-language pathologists and researchers. The codes focused on cognitive domains most affected in highly prevalent neurodevelopmental conditions, including attention, receptive language, statistical learning, and working memory.
            
            
              Results:
              We identified multiple subfeatures for our constructs of interest. Using this coding framework, we found that NVIQ tests qualitatively differ in the extent to which these four constructs influence test performance.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Our findings suggest that understanding the impact of cognitive constructs on NVIQ tests can help explain why children with neurodevelopmental disorders exhibit lower and more unstable NVIQ scores compared to their peers. We provide recommendations for the use of NVIQ tests with neurodevelopmental disorder populations and encourage researchers and clinicians in speech and hearing sciences and psychology to use our results to inform test interpretation and selection.

              Purpose:
              The most significant document to ensure effective and compliant design, implementation, monitoring, and enforcement of a program of special education services in the United States is the Individualized Education Program (IEP). Although IEPs have been used to document procedural compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) for individual students, IEPs also provide extensive data that can and should be used by a variety of stakeholders including speech-language pathologists (SLPs), school administrators, and state education agencies to design targeted professional development and collectively improve programs, processes, and outcomes in special education.
            
            
              Method:
              We summarize existing literature on the use of IEP data and describe opportunities to use IEP data to analyze individual student service patterns and SLP practice patterns. Aggregated IEP data also provide a robust view of district-wide and state trends in eligibility rates and least restrictive environment settings. Information on current and potential IEP data uses, reflection questions for substantive compliance, and lessons learned from a large-scale analysis of IEP data are provided. These lessons include potential software adjustments to enhance usability as a data source for substantive compliance; program improvement; and monitoring individual, school-wide, and district-wide outcomes.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              IEP data are a rich data source of information that may be used to (a) identify trends; (b) assist schools, districts, and states with ensuring substantive compliance with IDEA; (c) examine service equity and efficacy; (d) identify professional development needs; and (e) identify promising practices and provide opportunities to use real-time data to improve models and address public policy.},

	abstract = {Purpose:
              This study examined the effect of phonological overlap on English and Spanish expressive vocabulary accuracy as measured by the bilingual Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test–Fourth Edition (EOWPVT-IV). We hypothesized that if languages interact during an expressive vocabulary task, then higher phonological overlap will predict higher expressive vocabulary accuracy, especially in the nondominant language.
            
            
              Method:
              Twenty English-dominant bilingual children (English–Spanish) completed the bilingual EOWPVT-IV. We calculated phonological overlap between 117 English and Spanish words included in the bilingual EOWPVT using the Crosslinguistic Overlap Scale for Phonology.
            
            
              Results:
              Generalized logistic mixed-effect models revealed that phonological overlap and word frequency predicted vocabulary accuracy in Spanish, in addition to item difficulty. Age and item difficulty were the only predictors of English accuracy.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Phonological overlap was a significant predictor of Spanish vocabulary accuracy (the least dominant language of the children in our sample), suggesting a transfer between vocabulary in the dominant language into vocabulary in the least dominant language. Future studies should investigate how languages interact in bilingual children to provide us with information about how to create and administer vocabulary tests that represent vocabulary in each language and use vocabulary teaching strategies that promote dual language development.

	abstract = {Objective
              We conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review of literature comparing pre-reading and general reading in school-age children with nonsyndromic cleft palate with or without cleft lip (NSCP/L) to their peers without NSCP/L.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Our literature search identified 1238 possible records. After screening we identified 11 samples for inclusion for systematic review and eight for meta-analysis. We compared 292 children with NSCP/L to 311 peers for 23 pre-reading effect sizes and 17 general reading effect sizes (EF
                g
                ). We conducted a random-effects metaregression using robust variance estimation.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                On average school-age children with NSCP/L scored lower on pre-reading (EF
                g
                 = −0.36) and general reading measures (EF
                g
                 = −0.38) compared to their peers. We conducted post-hoc analyses on phonological awareness and word decoding effect sizes; children with NSCP/L performed lower on phonological awareness (EF
                g
                 = −0.22) and word decoding (EF
                g
                 = −0.39) compared to their peers. There was weak evidence that hearing status and/or speech-language functioning might moderate reading development. There was limited evidence that age or socioeconomic status moderated reading development. However, samples did not consistently report several characteristics that were coded for this project.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings suggest that school-age children with NSCP/L have persistent reading problems. Further research is needed to explore reading development in children with NSCP/L, as well as the relationships among hearing, speech, language, and reading development.},

Interstitial and terminal 6q25 deletions are associated with developmental delays, hypotonia, eye pathologies, craniofacial dysmorphologies, and structural brain anomalies. In most cases, speech and language deficits are not described in detail. We report on a case (Patient 1, age 7 years) with a de novo 6q25.3-qter deletion, 11.1Mb long and encompassing 108 genes, and a case (Patient 2, age 5 years) with an inherited interstitial 6q25.3 deletion, located within Patient 1's deletion region and 403kb long, the smallest 6q25 deletion reported to date. Both children have hypotonia, motor speech disorders, and expressive language delays. Patient 1's speech was characterized by childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) and dysarthria. Other findings include developmental delay, ataxic cerebral palsy, optic nerve dysplagia, and atypical brain morphologies regarding the corpus callosum and gyration patterns, a clinical profile that closely matches a previously reported case with a nearly identical deletion. Patient 2 had speech characterized by CAS and typical nonverbal processing abilities. His father, a carrier, had typical speech and language but showed difficulties with complex motor speech and hand motor tasks, similar to other adults with residual signs of CAS. The small deletion in this family contains the IGF2R-AIRN-SLC22A2-SLC22A3 gene cluster, which is associated with imprinting and maternal-specific expression of Igf2R, Slc22a2, and Slc22a3 in mice, whereas imprinting in humans is a polymorphic trait. The shared phenotypes in the two patients might be associated with the deletion of the gene cluster.},

The primary objective of this study was to describe the change in use of deletions and sub- stitutions in speech over the course of early intervention for children with cleft palate, with or without cleft lip (CP +/- L). Data from 25 participants were included in this analysis. The participants were part of a randomized control trial comparing Enhanced Milieu Teaching with Phonological Emphasis (EMT+PE) to a business-as-usual (BAU) group. Participants' speech errors were evaluated at four time points using the Profiles of Early Expressive Phonological Skills. The number of deletions and substitutions was as- sessed at each time point. Further investigation of substitutions was accomplished by comparing cleft-related speech substitutions to developmentally appropriate substitutions. Deletions increased from pre-intervention to mid-point then decreased through the three-month follow-up in both groups. Substitutions increased, decreased, and finally increased again from pre-intervention to the three-month follow-up. Cleft-related substitutions and developmental substitutions did not have the same growth pattern. These re- sults suggest that evaluation of intervention effects must focus on changes in a child's sound system beyond speech accuracy and note changes that mark speech sound progress toward adult-like productions. Additionally, moderate increases in speech errors at the three-month follow-up in the EMT+PE group indicate the need for continued support following the course of intervention},

Setting: Treatment was delivered in a university clinic by a trained speech-language pathologist. Participants: Thirty children aged between 15 and 36 months (M = 25) with nonsyndromic CP ± CL and typical cognitive development were randomly assigned to a treatment (EMT + PE) or business as usual comparison condition. Interventions: Participants in the EMT + PE treatment group received 48, 30-min sessions, over a 6-month period. Fidelity of treatment was high across participants. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measures were percent consonants correct (PCC), consonant inventory, compensatory articulation errors, and nasal emission. Results: Regression analyses controlling for pre-intervention child characteristics were conducted for PCC and consonant inventory. Intervention was not a significant predictor of post-intervention outcome. Words per minute differentiated the children who benefitted from the intervention from those who did not. Reduction in compensatory errors and nasal emission occurred in both groups but to a greater degree in the EMT + PE group. Conclusion: EMT + PE is a promising early speech intervention for young children with CP ± L, especially for children with higher rates of word use.},

Method: One hundred sixty-seven English-speaking second graders with typical development from three U.S. states participated. They completed five different tasks designed to assess children's creation, storage, retrieval, and production of the phonological and semantic representations of novel words and their ability to link those representations. The tasks encompassed the triggering and configuration stages of word learning. Results: Results showed that a latent variable model with separate phonological and semantic factors and linking indicators constrained to load on the phonological factor best fit the data. Discussion: The structure of word learning during triggering and configuration reflects separate but related phonological and semantic factors. We did not find evidence for a unidimensional latent variable model of word learning or for separate receptive and expressive word learning factors. In future studies, it will be interesting to determine whether the structure of word learning differs during the engagement stage of word learning when phonological and semantic representations, as well as the links between them, are sufficiently strong to affect other words in the lexicon.},

Children with NSCL/P had smaller consonant inventories (standardized mean difference effect size [ESg]=−1.24), less accurate articulation (ESg = −1.13), and more speech errors (ESg = 0.93) than their peers. Additionally, children with NSCL/P had poorer expressive (ESg = −0.57) and receptive (ESg = −0.59) language skills than their peers. Age and assessment type moderated effect sizes for expressive language. As children with NSCL/P aged, their expressive language performance became more similar to their peers. Expressive language effect sizes from parent reports and observational language measures (estimated effect size = −0.74) were significantly lower than those from standardized norm-referenced tests (estimated effect size = −0.45). Conclusions: These findings suggest that young children with NSCL/P experience delays relative to their peers across multiple speech and language constructs. Differences between children with NSCL/P and their typically developing peers appear to decrease with age.},

	abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between selective visual attention (SVA), reading decoding, listening comprehension and reading comprehension in children with and without a reading disorder. Methods: We used longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We split children into four groups: Typical Readers, Dyslexics, Poor Comprehenders and Comorbid Reading Disorder. We included measures of single word reading, nonword reading, spelling, phonological processing, vocabulary, receptive language, nonverbal intelligence, selective attention and reading comprehension. We used analysis of variance, correlations and structural equation modelling to examine the relationship between SVA and reading. We fit two possible models: SVA Indirect and SVA Direct. The difference between these models was the inclusion of a direct path from SVA to reading comprehension. Results: We examined an indirect model, where SVA predicted reading comprehension through word decoding and listening comprehension, and a direct model, which included a pathway from SVA to reading comprehension. Based on our analysis of variance and correlation results, we collapsed the Dyslexic, Poor Comprehenders and Comorbid Reading Disorder groups for the structural equation modelling. We found evidence that for Typical Readers, an indirect model was the best fit, whereas the direct model was the best model for children with a reading disorder. Conclusions: Selective visual attention is related to reading comprehension. This relationship differs for children with and without a reading disorder.},

In a nuclear family with two dually affected and one unaffected offspring, whole-exome sequences were evaluated for single nucleotide and indel variants and CNVs. The affected siblings but not the unaffected sibling share a rare deleterious compound heterozygous mutation in WWOX, implicated both in ASD and motor control. In addition, one of the affected children carries a rare deleterious de novo mutation in the ASD candidate gene RIMS1. The two affected children but not their unaffected sibling inherited deleterious variants with relevance for ASD and/or CAS. WWOX, RIMS1, and several of the genes harboring the inherited variants are expressed in the brain during prenatal and early postnatal development. Results suggest compound heterozygosity as a cause of ASD and CAS, pleiotropic gene effects, and potentially additional, complex genetic effects.},

	abstract = {Objective: We conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review of literature comparing pre-reading and general reading in school-age children with nonsyndromic cleft palate with or without cleft lip (NSCP/L) to their peers without NSCP/L. Methods: Our literature search identified 1238 possible records. After screening we identified 11 samples for inclusion for systematic review and eight for meta-analysis. We compared 292 children with NSCP/L to 311 peers for 23 pre-reading effect sizes and 17 general reading effect sizes (EFg). We conducted a random-effects metaregression using robust variance estimation. Results: On average school-age children with NSCP/L scored lower on pre-reading (EFg = −0.36) and general reading measures (EFg = −0.38) compared to their peers. We conducted post-hoc analyses on phonological awareness and word decoding effect sizes; children with NSCP/L performed lower on phonological awareness (EFg = −0.22) and word decoding (EFg = −0.39) compared to their peers. There was weak evidence that hearing status and/or speech-language functioning might moderate reading development. There was limited evidence that age or socioeconomic status moderated reading development. However, samples did not consistently report several characteristics that were coded for this project. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that school-age children with NSCP/L have persistent reading problems. Further research is needed to explore reading development in children with NSCP/L, as well as the relationships among hearing, speech, language, and reading development.},

	abstract = {Reading ability is a complex skill requiring multiple proficiencies (e.g., phonological awareness, decoding, and comprehension). Reading ability has genetic and environmental components that create the potential for significant gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, but the evidence for these interactions is limited. We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children and the Genes, Reading and Dyslexia Study to assess the contributions of genetic and demographic features to a continuous latent reading ability score. We then used this score as the phenotype on which to predicate genome-wide single nucleotide polymorph screening, followed by feature selection using an elastic net analysis. Results from the elastic net models showed that genetic and demographic features predicted reading ability for both cohorts. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with latent reading in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, as well as in the Genes, Reading and Dyslexia cohorts. For both cohorts, larger vocabularies were positively associated with latent reading ability. Genes within the neuron migration pathway were overrepresented in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort. We provide support that genes involved in early brain development have an impact on latent reading ability performance. Our findings also indicate high generalizability of genetic findings between cohorts, using our approach. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement The UK Medical Research Council Wellcome Trust Grant (ref: 217065/Z/19/Z) and the University of Bristol provide core support for ALSPAC.

	abstract = {Background: There is considerable variability in the presentation of developmental language disorder (DLD). Disagreement amongst professionals about how to characterize and interpret the variability complicates both the research on understanding the nature of DLD and the best clinical framework for diagnosing and treating children with DLD. We describe and statistically examine three primary possible models for characterizing the variability in presentation in DLD: predictable subtypes; individual differences; and continuum/spectrum. Aims: To test these three models of DLD in a population-based sample using two distinct types of cluster analyses. Methods \& Procedures: This study included children with DLD (n = 505) from the US Epidemiological Study of Language Impairment database. All available language and cognitive measures were included. Two cluster methods were used: Ward's method and K-means. Optimal cluster sizes were selected using Bayesian information criteria (BIC). Bootstrapping and permutation methods were used to evaluate randomness of clustering. Outcomes \& Results: Both clustering analyses yielded more than 10 clusters, and the clusters did not have spatial distinction: many of these clusters were not clinically interpretable. However, tests of random clustering revealed that the cluster solutions obtained did not arise from random aggregation. Conclusions \& Implications: Non-random clustering coupled with a large number of non-interpretable subtypes provides empirical support for the continuum/spectrum and individual differences models. Although there was substantial support for the continuum/spectrum model and weaker support for the individual differences model, additional research testing these models should be completed. Based on these results, clinicians working with children with DLD should focus on creating treatment plans that address the severity of functioning rather than seeking to identify and treat distinct subtypes. Additional consideration should be given to reconceptualizing DLD as a spectrum condition.},
